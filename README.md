# toy_app

This is basic application from [railstutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/toy_app), Here we develop a toy demo application to show off some of the power of Rails. The purpose is to get a high-level overview of Ruby on Rails programming (and web development in general) by rapidly generating an application using scaffold generators, which create a large amount of functionality automatically.
